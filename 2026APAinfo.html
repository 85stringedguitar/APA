        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          APA International Chamber Music Festival 2026 (ICMF2026) provides a
          venue in which both overseas and Japanese amateur players can
          participate in cultural exchange through music. Players from overseas
          will visit Japan for the festival to enjoy performing with Japanese
          players. It is the basic principle that international visitors and
          Japanese players perform the various works together (in mixed groups).
          Please note that rehearsal time will be limited and is described
          below.
          <br />
          *APA is the abbreviation of “Japan Amateur Players Association.”

          take place at Musashino Shimin Bunka Kaikan (Musashino Civic Cultural

          <br />

          <br />
          Participants can play in both concerts, or select one depending on
          their schedule. Overseas participants are advised to arrive in Japan
          one week before the concerts. We will have rehearsals (4 hours x 2
          times x 2 concerts if you attend both concerts) over the two weeks! We
          are planning a welcome reception for Saturday, March 21st or Sunday,
          March 22nd.

        <h2>Who Can Participate?</h2>
        <p>
          Any chamber music players, amateurs or pros are welcome. For the 7th
          ICMF2025, there were 13 overseas participants from the US, UK,
          Germany, the Netherlands, Canada and Portugal, as well as Japanese APA
          members. In the 4th ICMF2023, before the COVID pandemic, there were 17
          overseas participants. Many previous participants have enjoyed
          visiting the Tokyo Metropolitan area as well as the western part of
          Japan such as Kyoto, Hiroshima, Kyushu, or the north part of Japan,
          before or after the concerts.
        </p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Concert Details</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Two free concerts are scheduled in the Tokyo area in 2026.</li>
          <li>
            Note to previous participants: We will not plan to have concerts
            outside of Tokyo, such as in Atami, Hakone, nor Oshima island, this
            time.
          </li>
          <li>
            The same or different repertoire may be played in the two concerts.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is no admission fee for the audience as APA is an NPO
            (non-profit organization).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Rehearsals</h2>
        <p>
          Rehearsals will be limited to two sessions per concert, each lasting
          3-4 hours. There will also be a dress rehearsal at 9 a.m. each concert
          day. Both concerts will start at 1 p.m. There will be no coachings or
          lessons.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Ensemble Assignments</h2>
        <p>
          Each ensemble (trio or larger) will include a mix of overseas and
          Japanese players. Participants are encouraged to practice with their
          own ensemble (if possible) prior to arriving at the festival as
          rehearsal time in Japan will be limited. It is recommended that you
          request pieces which you have had prior experience playing.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>What to Play</h2>
        <p>
          Each participant may propose the music that they wish to play. The
          final decision, however, will be made by the organizer, depending on
          the number of participants and the types of instruments.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Participation Fee</h2>
        <p>
          The participation fee is 10,000 JPY per person for each concert,
          covering registration fee, hall rental, rehearsal room fees, program
          printing, etc. Accommodation is not included. An after-concert party
          will be planned, and the fee will be around 5,000-6,000 JPY, including
          free drinks. Please do not send money beforehand; the fee will be
          collected at the welcome reception or when you arrive.
          <br />
          <br />
          *1 USD is 156 JPY, or 1 EURO is 184 JPY, as of December 31, 2025
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Where to Stay</h2>
        <p>
          Accomodation (hotels, food, transportation fees, insurance, etc.) is
          the responsibility of each participant. We will help you arrange
          hotels upon request. Both concerts will be held in Musashino-city
          (outside of the central part of Tokyo), so it might be easiest if you
          choose a hotel there. Kichijoji is one of the convenient towns in that
          area, as both the Chuo Line and Keio Inokashira Line (trains) come in
          and out.
