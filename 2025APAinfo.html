            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>APA International Chamber Music Festival 2025 (ICMF2025) provides a venue in which both
                overseas and Japanese amateur players can participate in cultural exchange through music. Players
                from overseas will visit Japan for the festival to enjoy performing with Japanese players. It is the
                basic principle that international visitors and Japanese players perform the various works together
                (in mixed groups). Please note that rehearsal time will be limited and is described below.
                <br>
                *APA is the abbreviation of “Japan Amateur Players Association.”</p>
