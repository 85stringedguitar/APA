             <p> We are excited to announce that the APA International Chamber Music Festival for amateur chamber music
                players will return April 4-13 2023 as an ACMP-supported International Festival and Play-in. The last time the
                Festival was held was in April 2019 – it had to be postponed three times due to the COVID19 pandemic!
            </p><br>

            <h3> OVERVIEW OF THE APA INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL </h3>
            <p> The APA International Chamber Music Festival 2023 (ICMF2023) provides a venue in which both overseas and
                Japanese amateur players can participate in cultural exchange through music. Players from overseas visit
                Japan for the festival to enjoy playing, performing and socializing with Japanese amateur players. It is
                a basic tenet of the event that ensembles will comprise both international visitors and Japanese players
                in mixed groups. Please note that rehearsal time will be limited, and is described in the section “ Notes” below </p>
        </div>

        <h3>DATES AND VENUES</h3>
<strong>Welcome Reception </strong>- Tuesday, April 4, 2023. <br>
<strong>Performances</strong><br>

        In year 2019 there were 13 players from Europe, USA, Honk Kong and Singapore including several ACMP members. It
        was an 11 days event including an optional concert tour to Izu-Oshima Island on the last day.


        In year 2020 we will have two concerts in Koganei Tokyo and Atami Shizuoka after two days rehearsals each. The
        optional tour concert to Izu-Oshima Island in Sagami Bay will also be arranged.<br>


        

        <br>


        We welcome strings, winds and pianists eligible for performing chamber music with two days rehearsals prior to
        the concerts. Entries can be either preformed or individual basis. We will form groups by mixing foreign
        participants and Japanese players. In principle everyone plays in two ensembles. The music will be selected
        based on requests of the participants. There will be no coaching and no solo performance arranged in principle.
        <br>


        During the rehearsals we had a picnic to Koganei Park for watching cherry blossoms in 2109. On the way to Atami
        we had a tour to Hakone by train, rope way, cable car and pirate ship in Lake Ashinoko.<br>

        <p>The concerts at Koganei in Tokyo on March 30th Monday and in Atami on April 4th Saturday will be from 14pm to
            17pm, performed by preformed or mixed groups with Japanese players. <br>


            Two days rehearsals will be provided for each concert. Music for mixed groups will be arranged according to
            participants’ requests in principle. <br>


            It can be a whole or partial movements depending on nos. of programs. <br>


            The concerts will be publically announced and we expect full audience in the hall or at least we try to fill

        </p>






        <h2>
            <font color="red">Expenses</font>
        </h2>


        <p>In Principal, the cost for rehearsal rooms / concert halls will be evenly shared by all participants. A small
            amount of other expenses such as printing and advertisements will be added on top. Actual participation fee
            will be announced after all the bookings/arrangements are made.


            For your information, fees for the concerts and rehearsals will be around $100 depending on the nos. of
            participants. Accommodation, meals, insurance and transportation costs etc. are not included. <br>


            The dinner parties after the concerts will be at cost and it is about $35 per person. So far it is not
            possible to offer you a lump sum cost for this festival. <br>


            For the transportation to Atami, we utilized public transportations including cable car/rope way and pirate
            ship to go across the lake last year or we shall try to set up private cars of Japanese participants and
            will share the actual costs. A city tour to central Tokyo or picnic will be arranged and it will be at cost.

        <i>


            - Having safely arrived at Kyoto, I am thinking of how nice and exciting it was to participate in your
            festival. I already feel like slightly advanced into Japanese customs.(R.V.)<br>


            <br>





            - We only can express our admiration of what you have created. The APA-festival was wonderful planned and
            executed. I for myself would be glad if there will take place a similar event next year, and perhaps I will
            be enabled to participate for the second time to play again in this wonderful milieu??!(G.D.)<br>


            <br>





            - Thank you very much for a wonderful time in Japan! I am already excited (rather prematurely) about coming
            back and doing it all again! Please keep me informed about future opportunities (J.K.) <br>


            <br>





            - It was a wonderful experience for me and a good reason to finally visit Japan.(M.P.)<br>


            <br>





            - For me and my wife the eight days in Japan were absolutely fantastic. We enjoyed very much the company of
            your fellow-musicians. It gave us a very special window for observing Japan. (W.H.)</i>
