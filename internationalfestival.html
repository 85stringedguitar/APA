        <h3>the apa international festival</h3>
    </div>

             <p> We are pleased to announce that the next APA International Chamber Music Festival for amateur chamber music
                players will be held April 8-18, 2024. The festival returned in 2023 after a 
                COVID19-induced hiatus.  This year's format will be similar to last year's, with three concerts,
                the one in Hakone, play-in-style.  With Covid on the wane in Japan, we hope to see many more of 
                our foreign friends return.
            </p> <br>

        <h3>festival overview</h3>
    </div>
            <p> The APA International Chamber Music Festival 2024 (ICMF2024) provides a venue at which both overseas and
                Japanese amateur players can participate in cultural exchange through music. Players from overseas visit
                Japan for the Festival to enjoy playing, performing and socializing with Japanese amateur players. It is
                a basic tenet of the event that ensembles will comprise both international visitors and Japanese players
                in mixed groups. Please note that the emphasis of the Festival is on playing, and rehearsal time will be limited; see more about this in the sections below. </p>

        <h3>Who can participate?</h3>
    </div>
    <p>All amateur chamber music players are welcome--strings, winds and pianists.  Both pre-formed groups and individuals can be accommodated. We will create Festival ensembles by mixing overseas
        participants and Japanese players. In principle everyone plays in two ensembles. The music will be selected
        based on participant requests.  Rentals of big instruments such as double bass and cello can be arranged.  *A pre-formed overseas ensemble may be possible — please contact us to discuss.


        </p>



<div class="row">
        <span class="header-bar">|</span>
        <h3>Rehearsals</h3>
    </div>
<p>At least two rehearsals will be scheduled for each concert. Also, there will be a dress/stage rehearsal the morning of each concert. The second concert in Hakone can also serve as a rehearsal
opportunity for Atami.</p>
<div class="row">
        <span class="header-bar">|</span>
        <h3>Ensemble Assignments</h3>
    </div>

<p>Each Festival ensemble (trio, quartet, quintet, etc.) will consist of a combination of overseas and Japanese participants. As rehearsal time in Japan will be very limited, all ensemble members will need to be exceptionally well-prepared before meeting their Japanese or overseas colleagues. We suggest that, if possible, in addition to learning your individual part, you put together a group at home so that you can practice playing your part within an ensemble before the festival. </p>

<div class="row">
        <span class="header-bar">|</span>
        <h3>What to play</h3>
    </div>

<p>Each participant may propose the music that they wish to play. A final decision on repertoire will be made by the organizer based on the number of participants and the instruments they play. </p>

<div class="row">
        <span class="header-bar">|</span>
        <h3>Where to stay</h3>
    </div>

<p>The organizer will send you a list of hotels near the concert halls in Tokyo, Hakone and Atami via email. Participants will make their own accommodation arrangements (hotels, food, insurance, etc.). Participants will also be responsible for their own transportation costs within Japan.  Information about transportation will be provided.</p>

<div class="row">
        <span class="header-bar">|</span>
        <h3>Participation fee</h3>
    </div>

<p>The costs of the Festival will be shared by all participants.  A participation fee will be assessed to cover expenses such as rental fees for the concert halls and practice rooms, and printing fees for programs and flyers. (Again, accommodation is not included.)
    As a reference, the fee per person for the 2023 festival was 2,800 JPY (one concert) to 4,600 JPY (all concerts). An after-concert party fee will be around 4,500 including free
drinks.


The cost to register is 10,000 JPY*. The registration fee will count towards the participation fee; the precise total due will be adjusted at a later date. The participation fee can be brought to the welcome reception in Tokyo (no need to send it beforehand).<p>


<br>*1 USD is 141 JPY; 1 EURO is 156 JPY, as of January 2, 2024.
So, the registration fee of 10,000 JPY will be about 71 U.S. dollars, and/or 64 Euro. </p>
<div class="row">
        <span class="header-bar">|</span>
        <h3>Instruction</h3>
    </div>

<p>There will be no coachings, nor will any lessons be provided.</p>

        <img src="images/5thCMF_3.png" width="95%">


        <br>


        <br>


        <p>Miyaji-Gakki (former Koganei Civic Center) is located in front of JR Musashi-Koganei Station (at South Exit),
            which is about 17km west of Shinjuku Terminal, or 23km west of Tokyo or 35min. by JR (Japan Railway) from
            Tokyo Central Station. <br>


            Atami is a hot-spa seaside resort, about 100km south-west from Tokyo and around 50 min. from Tokyo Station
            by Shinkansen (the bullet train).<br>


            From Atami Station you can go to other cities by Shinkansen easily. We can arrange to keep your belongings
            during your journey in Japan if you wish.<br>


            <a href="http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2361.html" target="_blank">JR Pass</a> is a convenient travel ticket
            for foreign tourists.
        </p>






        <h2>
            <font color="red">Concert Style</font>
        </h2>


        <p>The concerts at Koganei in Tokyo on March 30th Monday and in Atami on April 4th Saturday will be from 14pm to
            17pm, performed by preformed or mixed groups with Japanese players. <br>


            Two days rehearsals will be provided for each concert. Music for mixed groups will be arranged according to
            participants’ requests in principle. <br>


            It can be a whole or partial movements depending on nos. of programs. <br>


            The concerts will be publically announced and we expect full audience in the hall or at least we try to fill
            up the hall. <br>


            In the past there were always more than 100 audiences.


        </p>






        <h2>
            <font color="red">Expenses</font>
        </h2>


        <p>In Principal, the cost for rehearsal rooms / concert halls will be evenly shared by all participants. A small
            amount of other expenses such as printing and advertisements will be added on top. Actual participation fee
            will be announced after all the bookings/arrangements are made.


            For your information, fees for the concerts and rehearsals will be around $100 depending on the nos. of
            participants. Accommodation, meals, insurance and transportation costs etc. are not included. <br>


            The dinner parties after the concerts will be at cost and it is about $35 per person. So far it is not
            possible to offer you a lump sum cost for this festival. <br>


            For the transportation to Atami, we utilized public transportations including cable car/rope way and pirate
            ship to go across the lake last year or we shall try to set up private cars of Japanese participants and
            will share the actual costs. A city tour to central Tokyo or picnic will be arranged and it will be at cost.
        </p>






        <h2>
            <font color="red">Accommodations</font>
        </h2>


        <p>We recommend you to arrange your accommodation by yourself. In the past many participants used airbnbs. We
            can assist upon your request of the location, preference and period. The following are the hotels in our
            neighborhood.<br>


            In Tokyo;<br>

            Station is about 5min. (2nd station beyond) by JR Line. <br>

    </div>
       


        <i>


            <p>- Having safely arrived at Kyoto, I am thinking of how nice and exciting it was to participate in your
            festival. I already feel like slightly advanced into Japanese customs. (R.V.)</p>


            <br>





            <p>- We only can express our admiration of what you have created. The APA-festival was wonderfully planned and
            executed. I for myself would be glad if there will take place a similar event next year, and perhaps I will
            be enabled to participate for the second time to play again in this wonderful milieu??! (G.D.)</p>


            <br>





            <p>- Thank you very much for a wonderful time in Japan! I am already excited (rather prematurely) about coming
            back and doing it all again! Please keep me informed about future opportunities (J.K.) </p>


            <br>





           <p>- It was a wonderful experience for me and a good reason to finally visit Japan. (M.P.)</p>


            <br>





            <p>- For me and my wife the eight days in Japan were absolutely fantastic. We enjoyed very much the company of
            your fellow-musicians. It gave us a very special window for observing Japan. (W.H.)</p></i>
